As far as I can tell, it seems as though everything has been correctly implemented. Rob Ruenes helped me understand how git/SSH-ing would work (how SSH-ing would not be necessary except for the index.html). I spent somewhere between 4-6 hours on this assignment, mainly because I was reading about many of the topics. Since I am new to HTML, I felt like this reading helped a lot.
